# AI Appraisal and Hype

### Articles and resources that appraise versus hype machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence

Throughout my career, I have found "[artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)" to be an exceptionally fascinating buzzword. Of course, almost every buzzword that enters corporate jargon (e.g. "Big Data", "Internet of Things", "Blockchain", "BitCoin", etc) will be shrouded with hype, only to have expectations be disappointed and corporations chase something else. But "artificial intelligence" is different for two reasons: 

1) It is ubiquitously hyped and invested to an unusally large scale. 

2) Unlike other buzzwords, "AI" has gone through cycles of AI booms and "[AI Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter)" over past several decades. 

While many of my colleagues in operations research circles dismiss the "artificial intelligence" buzzword as media hype and tabloid, such hype has still had an effect on society. Many Fortune 500 CEO's, law makers, venture capitalists, general population, and even technology professionals are under the impression SkyNet is upon us. Likely driven by FOMO, billions of U.S. dollars are poured into AI research but those funding such initiatives do not quite understand the technology or what it actually is good at. 

This widespread gap between expectations and reality have fascinated me. It's not uncommon to pick up an article with a sensational title that makes you think artificial general intelligence has been achieved, only to find the "AI" it is describing has merely categorized images. 

My Pocket bookmarks are getting full with these hype and appraisal articles, so I am going to start dumping them here on this GitHub page for my own organization and to share with others. Feel free to contribute your own too.  It is fascinating to compare these two narratives and how they contrast each other, and it will be interesting to see how things play out as investors and CEO's start demanding financial return from AI technologies.
